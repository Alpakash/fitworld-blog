## Commitment
Hereby I create this update to make a commitment and accountability to myself and others.
Fitworld has been a long-time idea for me. It's time to refine the idea, plan, and execute it.

I would like to make frequent updates on the progress of this application. It will be created with Flutter.
This means that the Fitworld application will be available for iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop.

The ambitions are big, so I will start with the website which is sharing all developments regarding Fitworld on: [www.fitworld.dev](https://www.fitworld.dev/).
The web application however will live on [www.fitworld.app](https://www.fitworld.app/), here you can will be able to use the application.

## Old Designs
These designs are from a while ago, these are from 2019. It's time for a revamp!

## New Designs or revamp
The old designs are a nice guide for our v0.1, I would like to re-iterate on the old designs. Things that I'm going to reconsider are:
- Color Palette
- Typography, Icons, and Layout
- Animations
- Workflow UX
- Logo

## MVP
During the upcoming year, Fitworld will be in full development. Starting with the designs, followed by the Minimal Viable Product, which is intended to serve as a pitch. From here we can try to release an Alpha version to be tested by our community. We hope to receive a lot of feedback in that phase. The idea is to co-create the application by then.

A few features that come to mind, which I want to add to this application, are:
1. Join workouts around the world
    - Share your workouts with your friends
    - Review the workouts and their instructors
    - Make use of discounts of our connected partners after certain achievements are unlocked

2. Social engagement features
    - Connect with others and invite them to a workout
    - Follow other users and see their workouts
    - See achievements and badges of others

3. Dashboard for managers
    - Overview of instructors and their reviews
    - Overview of workouts and their reviews
    - Overview of users and their reviews
    - CRUD for all workouts

4. Dashboard for creators
    - CRUD for their own workouts
    - Total visitors via our app and pay-outs 

5. Dashboard for users
    - Total amount of workouts
    - Achievements and badges

6. Think about a fair pricing system
    - Pricing for the users
    - Pricing system for workouts
    - Pricing system for creators

7. And more... I will take you on a journey of the creation of Fitworld. 

Lets make this a wonderful 2024, full of action. Happy new year!
